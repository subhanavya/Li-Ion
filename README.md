Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in applications like laptops, mobile phones, and electric vehicles due to their long cycle life, high power, and energy densities. The battery's life is influenced by various factors, including charge/discharge cycles, current, voltage, temperature, and depth of discharge. This project uses LSTM models to predict battery capacity based on voltage, current, and temperature profiles from charging cycles, implemented using the Keras deep learning library. The lithium-ion battery dataset is sourced from the NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository.
